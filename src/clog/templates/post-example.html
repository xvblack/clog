            <h1>An exhibit of Markdown</h1>

            <p>This note demonstrates some of what <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is capable of doing.</p>

            <p><em>Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn&#8217;t automatically save itself.</em></p>

            <h2>Basic formatting</h2>

            <p>Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.</p>

            <p>Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> is supported. This <em>can be <strong>nested</strong> like</em> so.</p>

            <h2>Lists</h2>

            <h3>Ordered list</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>A second item</li>
                <li>Number 3</li>
                <li>Ⅳ</li>
            </ol>

            <p><em>Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm">Roman numeral four</a>.</em></p>

            <h3>Unordered list</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>An item</li>
                <li>Another item</li>
                <li>Yet another item</li>
                <li>And there&#8217;s more&#8230;</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Paragraph modifiers</h2>

            <h3>Code block</h3>

            <pre><code>Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.
</code></pre>

            <p>You can also make <code>inline code</code> to add code into other things.</p>

            <h3>Quote</h3>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Headings</h2>

            <p>There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You&#8217;ve probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.</p>

            <h3>Headings <em>can</em> also contain <strong>formatting</strong></h3>

            <h3>They can even contain <code>inline code</code></h3>

            <p>Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.</p>

            <p>I don&#8217;t recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you&#8217;re smallest heading isn&#8217;t too small, and you&#8217;re largest heading isn&#8217;t too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.</p>

            <h2>URLs</h2>

            <p>URLs can be made in a handful of ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A named link to <a href="http://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a>. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit <code>Ctrl+L</code>.</li>
                <li>Another named link to <a href="http://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a></li>
                <li>Sometimes you just want a URL like <a href="http://www.markitdown.net/">http://www.markitdown.net/</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Horizontal rule</h2>

            <p>A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.</p>

            <hr />

            <p>It&#8217;s sometimes handy for breaking things up.</p>

            <h2>Images</h2>

            <p>Markdown can also contain images. I&#8217;ll need to add something here sometime.</p>

            <img src="http://static.lyric.im/uploads/what-is-chrome-os-01.png" alt="compare to iOS and chrome">

            <img src="http://moeka.me/img/moeka.jpg" alt="moeka">

            <h2>Finally</h2>

            <p>There&#8217;s actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">introduction</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.</p>
